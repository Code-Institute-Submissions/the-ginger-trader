- get a quote form

- responsiveness

At every stage of the development process the responsiveness of the site has been checked (within gitpod and google inspect) as 
the grid structuring uses responsive parameters for display effectiveness i.e. the "what we do" and "testimonials" sections
are displayed as a single column on mobile and as two columns for a medium screen width and four columns for a large screen width.
